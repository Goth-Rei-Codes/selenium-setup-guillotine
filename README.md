# Selenium Setup Guillotine
### What is Selenium?
[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is a scraping and website testing framework. It is based on many languages:
* [Java](https://www.java.com/it/)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp)

I usually work with Java-based Selenium

### So what can i do to use Selenium?
There are few simple steps to start using Selenium:

1. Integrate the [Selenium dependecies](https://github.com/Rei-Codes-In-JavaScript/selenium-setup-guillotine-/blob/main/Pom_Dependencies) in the pom.xml file inside your project

2. Create your Main class, in which you will write all your tests. You can use this [template](https://github.com/Rei-Codes-In-JavaScript/selenium-setup-guillotine-/blob/main/Main_Template) as a base/reference 
  > **WARNING**: remember to change the ChromeDriver path with your ChromeDriver path inside ___System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "CHROMEDRIVER_PATH");___

### What if i refuse to use Selenium?
Statistics confirm a 100% decrease in dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin production.
<p>Additionally, scientific studies say 99.9% of people who drop out of using Selenium fail to achieve satisfaction in their job.</p>
